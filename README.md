# predicting-depression
Project to download neuroimaging data (fMRI, sMRI, and DTI), run the MRI data through NiPype, build regressors on these MRI data to predict depressive behaviors, and predict depressive behaviors from simply MRI data.

# Getting to know the MPI-Leipzig Mind-Brain-Body Dataset

We provide a Jupyter Notebook allowing users to investigate what range of behavioral data is available from the MPI-Leipzig dataset. A non-interactive view of the page may be found using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sguthrie/predicting-depression/blob/master/MPI-LeipzigDataset.ipynb).
