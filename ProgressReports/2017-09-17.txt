## Theoretical Motivation

20% of all people are expected to fulfill the criteria for major depressive
disorder (MDD) at some point in their lifetime, and MDD is the second leading
contributor to chronic disease burden, yet 50% of patients do not respond or
remiss to their first treatment[^Benazzi] [^Gartlehner] [^Otte].

We hope to build a model with a known confidence from over 100 subjects that
can predict depression severity given the resting-state fMRI of a subject. We
predict the connectivity patterns weighted by the model will implicate regions
and tracts affected by and necessary for a depressive phenotype, furthering
research into the etiology of depression.

## Research Design

1. Choose a dataset with at least 100 subjects who cover a range of depressive
   severity.
   - The MPI-Leipzig dataset has ~6 moderately depressed subjects measured
     using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). All subjects in the lower
     three-quartiles  are not considered to be depressed. [BDI](https://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov/doc/noc/beck_depression_inventory_noc_link.pdf)
   - This pattern is also observed using the HADS-D score to measure depression.
2. Find subjects which have behavioral data of BDI, HADS-D, and NEO-N, and do not
   fail quality control testing (as run by mriqc).
3. Preprocess the subjects fulfilling the above requirements.
4. Build a connectome for each subject using nilearn.
5. Separate subjects into a large training set and a small test set. (Note, we
   may also choose a new dataset.)
6. Build 3 cognitive-based predictive model (CPM) to predict depressive
   phenotypes: BDI, HADS-D, and NEO-N.
   - For each edge in all subjects connectomes, correlate the strength of that
     edge with the phenotype score. Edges that are most strongly related to
     behavior in the positive and negative directions are retained for model
     building. Use cross-validation to ensure reliability of the positive network
     and the negative network.
   - Build a linear model relating each individualâ€™s positive network strength
     (i.e., the sum of the connections in their positive network) and negative
     network strength (i.e., the sum of the connections in their negative
     network) to their behavioral score.
7. Check the validity of the model against the test set. Predictive power is
   assessed by correlating predicted and observed behavioral scores across
   the group.

CPM will be based on the research done by Shen *et al*, 2017[^Shen].

All computing is currently planned to run using cwl-runner on Arvados, which
provides a reproducible computing infrastructure.

## Statistical Analysis

The statistical analysis involved in this project will involve correlating the
strength of each edge with the phenotype score, model-fitting the CPM, and
using cross-validation.

Building a CPM uses a form of linear regression, such as Pearson's correlation,
Spearman's correlation, or robust regression. We plan to use Spearman's rank
correlation instead of Pearson's correlation, since depressive severity does
not follow a normal distribution in our data. We will use a significance
threshold of $P=0.01$ to choose significantly positive or negative edges in the
CPM.

We will fit the CPM model using a least squares polynomial fit (numpy.polyfit)

We shall evaluate the mean squared error and the true prediction correlation to
to evaluate the prediction performance of the CPM model.
