Work In Progress

## Theoretical Motivation

## Research Design

1. Choose a dataset with at least 100 subjects who cover a range of depressive
   symptoms.
   - The MPI-Leipzig dataset has ~6 moderately depressed subjects by the BDI
     score. All subjects in the lower three-quartiles are not considered to be
     depressed. [BDI](https://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov/doc/noc/beck_depression_inventory_noc_link.pdf)
   - This pattern is continued by the HADS-D score.
2. Find subjects which have behavioral data of BDI, HADS-D, and NEO-N, and do not
   fail quality control testing (as run by mriqc).
3. Preprocess the subjects fulfilling the above requirements.
4. Build a connectome for each subject using nilearn.
5. Separate subjects into a large training set and a small test set. (Note, we
   may also choose a new dataset.)
6. Build 3 cognitive-based predictive model (CPM) to predict depressive
   phenotypes: BDI, HADS-D, and NEO-N.
   - For each edge in all subjects connectomes, correlate the strength of that
     edge with the phenotype score. Edges that are most strongly related to
     behavior in the positive and negative directions are retained for model
     building. Use cross-validation to ensure reliability of the positive network
     and the negative network.
   - Build a linear model relating each individualâ€™s positive network strength
     (i.e., the sum of the connections in their positive network) and negative
     network strength (i.e., the sum of the connections in their negative
     network) to their behavioral score.
7. Check the validity of the model against the test set. Predictive power is
   assessed by correlating predicted and observed behavioral scores across
   the group.

CPM is based on https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5366090/

All computing is currently planning to run these using cwl-runner on Arvados,
which offers a free trial for reproducible computing.
